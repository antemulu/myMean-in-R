# myMean-in-R
Evaluating the function to calculate Mean 

#evaluate the following function call myMean. The data for this function called assignment. 

#mean is one of the three main measures of central tendency in R programming language.



assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

myMean <- mean(assignment2)

print(myMean) 



Result



> assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

> myMean <- mean(assignment2)

> print(myMean) 

[1] 19.25



In RStudio I used the below syntax to calculate the mean 
Syntax
The basic syntax for calculating mean in R is −

mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
Following is the description of the parameters used −

x is the input vector.

trim is used to drop some observations from both end of the sorted vector.

na.rm is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.
